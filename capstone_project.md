# Capstone Project: Integrating Skills & Creativity

## Overview

This is your **final capstone project**, where you will bring together everything you’ve learned this year. The goal is to design and build something creative, functional, and well-documented. You can choose to base your project on an existing idea or create something entirely new. The emphasis is on creativity, integration of skills, and clear presentation.

## Requirements

### Project Components

Your project must include **at least three areas** from the following list:

- Raspberry Pi (sensors, GPIO, web servers, automation, etc.)
- Python programming (scripts, APIs, automation, robotics)
- Web development (HTML, CSS, JS, Flask, etc.)
- Mobile/UI apps (Flutter, Dart, frontend work)
- Robotics/drones (RoboMaster, Tello, coding movement)
- 3D printing/design (Tinkercad, Thingiverse, custom models)
- Documentation/design (Canva, instructions, diagrams)
- Version control or structured project files (GitHub, ZIP file, folders)

### Submission Requirements

You will submit:

1. **Demo Video (2–5 minutes)**

   - Show your project in action.
   - Explain how it works and the steps involved.
   - Demonstrate key features and edge cases.

2. **Canva Presentation (well-designed and clear)**
   Your Canva presentation must include:

   - Title/cover slide
   - How it works (flow, diagrams, block structure)
   - Steps (development process, build steps)
   - Problems solved (issues you ran into and solutions)
   - Materials & tools used
   - Future improvements
   - Photos, screenshots, and diagrams
   - Credits/references for tutorials or libraries used

   *Presentations should be visually appealing, professional, and easy for anyone to follow.*

3. **Project Files & Code**

   - Submit via GitHub repository OR ZIP file.
   - Include a README with setup/run instructions.
   - Ensure code is commented and organized.
